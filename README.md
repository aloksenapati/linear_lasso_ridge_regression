# linear_lasso_ridge_regression
machine learning on various kind regression in python with sk_learn package 

If you have regression overfited model,like high varience and low bias we applied to reduce the coefficent we use ridge and lasso techniques.
In ridge the regression coefficent reduced and in lasso regression the coefficent reduced to zero which are less important by tuning the paramerter.
